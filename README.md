# Square Number

## Objectives
* Write a method that, when given a square number, returns the integer that when squared, results in the given argument without using Ruby's built-in math methods, like `sqrt(x)`.
* This method should return false when given a number that is not a square number.

## Introduction
* "In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;[1] in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as 3 × 3." -[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number)
* Challenge yourself and avoid using Ruby's built-in math methods, such as `sqrt(x)`.
